We accidentally uploaded an experimental version of A6 by the submission deadline, not the correct version.
While working on A7 (combining CLI + Bootloader + OTAFU), we realized this is not the most recent version. Upon speaking to Prof. Garcia and TAs, we were told there would be no late penalty for uploading the fully correct version.
