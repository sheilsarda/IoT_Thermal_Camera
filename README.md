# Course Wrap-up

Hello Everyone:

Thank you very much for your time and energy in this semester's class. I wanted to send this email as a wrap up of the class, to indicate some tips and next steps that I hope can prove useful. As an additional note, I have attached the Microchip Crypto Primer slides that Dan presented to the class.

## What comes after Altium - Alternatives

In the class we learned about PCB Design using Altium Studio which fortunately Penn has licenses for. There are free alternatives in case you want to continue developing PCBs but do not have access to Altium. They are:

1. [Circuit Maker](https://circuitmaker.com/). This is the online-based free version of Altium. will have most of the utility seen in class.  It is cloud based, which means all the projects will live on the cloud. I have used it and I consider it pretty good.
1. [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/). Open source software for PCB development. Very popular alternative to Altium, and Free! It is also cross platform.
1. [Autodesk Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview). I have not used it since the days it was free. Now it is $15 a month.

## PCB Fabrication
This class used PCB:NG for mixed results. I wanted to share some of my favorite PCB manufacturers with you to keep in mind if you want to do future PCB work.

1. [PCBWAY](https://www.pcbway.com/). Very good PCB fab house, based in China. You can quote the cost on the PCB and assembly online, and their process is very good. You can tell them (for assembly) to buy the components themselves, or send it to them directly from Digikey. I fully recommend them!
1. [Sierra Circuits](https://www.protoexpress.com/). Very good PCB fab house in the States (California). Really good turnaround - I would consider them if you are doing something for work or school - they are not in the price range for hobbyists! Their main advantage lies in that they do a very thorough analisys of your design, and they are very good at "catching" manufacturability issues and letting you know so they can be fixed.

## Interesting Microcontroller Recommendations

There are multiple interesting microcontrollers out there, each with their own advantages. i wanted to share some in case you would like to know more about them. The following options have very inexpensive dev kits you can buy on Amazon or Digikey.

1. ST: I really like ST and use them extensively. They have a supporting software, called CubeMX, which really helps with the phase of HW and FW design (very similar to Atmel Start). Give them a try!  https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/support/learning/stm32-education.html
1. Rigado: If you need Bluetooth, I heavily recommend a micro from Nordic! Nordic make really good MCUs with built in Bluetooth, but they are very small and sometimes their size alone can drive the cost of the PCB manufacturing (smaller vias and traces equals a more expensive board!). This is sometimes dealt with with the use of modules. Rigado makes modules based on the Nordic chips that take care of complicated electronics needed to run the Nordic chip, and give you a nice module (A la SAMW25). They use a really good (free) development studio called Segger Embedded Studio (free for using the Nordic chips). Give them a try!  https://www.rigado.com/products/wireless-modules/

## Connectors

There exists a ton of connectors, and sometimes you may have seen a connector but have no idea what the name is to find them online! It happens to me a lot.

For this, I recommend the Connector page of Digikey (accesible from the front splash page - on the left, click on "connectors"). Or see this link: https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/connectors/index

You can then go through the connector selection with representative images of the connectors on each category.

## How useful is to know how to make PCBs? And how useful is to do personal projects as an Engineer?

I hope this class gave you the resources you need to bring any electrical project to manufacturing, be it a class project, an academia project, or an industry project.

As a finishing point I wanted to explain how important it is to do personal projects that you can showcase as a portafolio. Projects can be a great way to find new laboral opportunities and to showcase your skills and stand out.

As an example, I wanted to share the work of a friend and colleague. His name is Samson March, and he had been working as a pet project on making his own smart watch. I can attest he worked on it for a really long time. He recently published his project as a Open Source Project, and the project gained so much traction online that he started receiving job opportunities from very interesting companies. You can see the project [here](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/5/18528008/smartwatch-build-your-own-diy-wearable).

I mention this example as a way to motivate you to do your own projects, which I hope this class helped on how to do. Also, on the importance of documentation of said projects! I would recommend, as you do your future school projects or personal projects, to document them AND to take nice pictures! I recommend lightboxes available on Amazon if you want to take nice pictures (Price around 10-50 dollars).
